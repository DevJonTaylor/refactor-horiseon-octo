This project's goal was refactor the code to include semantic HTML and organize/otimize 
the css.  I feel was successful as I was able to include main, section, article, and 
nav to name a few without loosing the requested mock up display.  You can reach the 
finished product [here](https://devjontaylor.github.io/urban-octo-telegram/).
